              Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of
              southwestern India, is one of the most popular tourist
              destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of
              the world by National Geographic Traveler,[1] Kerala is famous
              especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful
              backwaters.[2] Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its
              varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular
              tourist destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%,
              the tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's
              economy.[3]
